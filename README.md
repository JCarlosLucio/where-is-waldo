### Install

```sh
npm install
```

Installs dependencies.

### Start

```sh
npm run start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### Test

```sh
npm run test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### Eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

```sh
npm run eject
```

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t
customize it when you are ready for it.

  scoped to a Component.
- Deployment to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Fix routing after deploying to GitHub Pages with `<HashRouter />`.
